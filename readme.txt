== Description ==
This WordPress plugin outputs a list of fonts used on any front end page in the javascript console in case you are logged in as an admin user.


== Installation ==
Install this plugin like you would install any other plugin.

Once activated, you will be able to see an array of fonts used on the front end, in the javascript console, on any page.

== Plans ==
v2.0 - User interface will be added where admins will be able to highlight elements of a selected font family.
V3.0 - More CSS properties besides font-family will be included in the plugin.
